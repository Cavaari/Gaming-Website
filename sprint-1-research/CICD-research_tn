CI/CD Research Notes

What is CI/CD
    • Continuous Integration (CI): Automated process enabling developers to merge code changes frequently to a shared branch or “trunk”. It includes automated testing to ensure the reliability of merged code changes (TechTarget​​, Red Hat​​).
    • Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD): Automates stages beyond CI, like code delivery to a repository, and possibly automated deployment to production environments (TechTarget​​, Red Hat​​).
      
CI/CD Pipeline Stages
    • Source Stage: Involves branching strategies for concurrent development and initial quality checks like linting (Codefresh​​).
    • Build Stage: Source code is compiled into a product; involves tasks like resolving dependencies and running preliminary tests (Pluralsight​​, Codefresh​​).
    • Test Stage: Comprehensive automated testing to ensure functionality and quality. Includes integration, performance, and security tests (Pluralsight​​, Codefresh​​).
    • Deploy Stage: Final stage, releasing the application into the production environment. It should be fully automated (TechTarget​​, Codefresh​​).
      
Benefits of CI/CD
    • Efficiency & Quality: Automates repetitive tasks, reduces human error, and allows faster release of new features (BrowserStack​​).
    • Rapid Feedback & Collaboration: Enhances team collaboration, improves code quality, and leads to a more resilient and secure software (GitHub Resources​​, BrowserStack​​).
    • Scalability & Innovation: Adapts to growing development needs and fosters a culture of continuous improvement and innovation (GitHub Resources​​, BrowserStack​​).
    • Challenges in CI/CD Implementation
    • Integration Complexity: Balancing multiple code changes and ensuring compatibility can be challenging (Rapid7​​).
    • Maintaining Automation: Requires consistent updates and maintenance to ensure efficient continuous integration and deployment (Rapid7​​).

Popular CI/CD Tools
    • Jenkins: Open-source automation server known for its flexibility and extensive plugin availability (Pluralsight​​).
    • GitLab: Provides a comprehensive CI/CD solution, including repository management and automated testing (Pluralsight​​).
